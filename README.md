This is a repository for me and my collegue Vincenzo Carandente cognitive project based on visual recognition by FuseMedML.

In the project folder can be found:
- Immagini: folder contains the figure output of the classification
- output: folder contains the text file regarding to the classification task, such as best epoch and final results we obtained
- Python Notebook contains the execution code
- A powerpoint presentation with some description of the process we have done
- PDF file exported from the notebook itself
- A user guide for the library FuseMedML, with some description of the object and a universal template

During this execution we have used **FuseMedML**; found some documentation to the link https://github.com/IBM/fuse-med-ml
