This is a repository for my cognitive project based on visual recognition by FuseMedML.

In the project folder can be found:
- Immagini: folder contains the figure output of the classification
- output: folder contains the text file regarding to the classification task, such as best epoch and final results I obtained
- Python Notebook contains the execution code
- PDF file exported from the notebook itself
- A user guide for the library FuseMedML, with some description of the object and a universal template

During this execution I have used **FuseMedML**; found some documentation to the link https://github.com/IBM/fuse-med-ml
